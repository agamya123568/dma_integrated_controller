# Simple DMA Controller (AMD 2940–Inspired)
This repository contains a simple, educational DMA controller written in Verilog,
inspired by the architecture of classic DMA controllers such as the AMD 2940.

The design focuses on:
- Instruction-driven control
- Separate word and address counters
- Explicit commit-based handshaking
- Clean, synchronous DONE generation
- Modular, readable RTL suitable for learning and simulation
